# Google Vision for Logo detection

This code leverages the Google Vision API to detect logos within an image file. It annotates each identified logo with its description and confidence score, providing valuable insights into the recognized brand elements. Furthermore, the code enhances interpretability by visualizing the detected logos through bounding boxes drawn using the provided vertices, facilitating a clear understanding of their spatial locations within the image.
