# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my collection of computer vision projects! This repository showcases my work in computer vision, including image processing, object detection, OCR and image classification. Each project demonstrates my expertise in building computer vision models to solve real-world problems and tasks.

## Project Highlights

- **Google Vision API for Logo detection**: This code utilizes the Google Vision API for logo detection. It processes an image file containing logos, annotating each detected logo with its description and confidence score. Additionally, it visualizes the detected logos by drawing bounding boxes around them using the provided vertices.
- **OCR-Image identification**: This project aims to implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) utilizing EasyOCR to extract text from a P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) PDF. Additionally, it incorporates symbol detection using the YOLOv8 model to precisely identify symbols within the same document, showcasing a comprehensive approach to document analysis and information extraction.


Feel free to explore each project and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
